League of Legends Data Analysis (CS210 Course Project)
This project focuses on the analysis of League of Legends data to derive insights into gaming performance and predict match outcomes. The analysis incorporates various gaming metrics, including kills, deaths, assists, gold earned, and total damage dealt to champions. Additionally, qualitative information such as the champion name is considered to capture the unique attributes associated with each champion.
